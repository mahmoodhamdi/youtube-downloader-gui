## üßë‚Äçüíª Code Quality & Architecture Improvements

* [ ] Restructure into modular project structure (separate core, UI, utils, services)
* [ ] Implement clear MVC-like or layered architecture:

  * **Model**: Video data, queue items, config models
  * **Controller/Service**: Download logic, extraction, progress updates
  * **View**: Tkinter GUI
* [ ] Create centralized error and logging module
* [ ] Decouple GUI from backend logic (event queues or observer pattern)
* [ ] Add docstrings and consistent type annotations
* [ ] Write unit tests for core logic (config, queue, extractors, download)
* [ ] Integrate linting and code formatting (e.g., Black, isort)
* [ ] Document public interfaces and modules
